AB  - OBJECTIVES: To noninvasively differentiate meningioma grades by deep learning 
      radiomics (DLR) model based on routine post-contrast MRI. METHODS: We enrolled 181 
      patients with histopathologic diagnosis of meningioma who received post-contrast MRI 
      preoperative examinations from 2 hospitals (99 in the primary cohort and 82 in the 
      validation cohort). All the tumors were segmented based on post-contrast axial T1 
      weighted images (T1WI), from which 2048 deep learning features were extracted by the 
      convolutional neural network. The random forest algorithm was used to select 
      features with importance values over 0.001, upon which a deep learning signature was 
      built by a linear discriminant analysis classifier. The performance of our DLR model 
      was assessed by discrimination and calibration in the independent validation cohort. 
      For comparison, a radiomic model based on hand-crafted features and a fusion model 
      were built. RESULTS: The DLR signature comprised 39 deep learning features and 
      showed good discrimination performance in both the primary and validation cohorts. 
      The area under curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity for predicting meningioma 
      grades were 0.811(95% CI, 0.635-0.986), 0.769, and 0.898 respectively in the 
      validation cohort. DLR performance was superior over the hand-crafted features. 
      Calibration curves of DLR model showed good agreements between the prediction 
      probability and the observed outcome of high-grade meningioma. CONCLUSIONS: Using 
      routine MRI data, we developed a DLR model with good performance for noninvasively 
      individualized prediction of meningioma grades, which achieved a quantization 
      capability superior over the hand-crafted features. This model has potential to 
      guide and facilitate the clinical decision-making of whether to observe or to treat 
      patients by providing prognostic information.
