AB  - With the improvement of external radiotherapy delivery accuracy, such as 
      intensity-modulated and stereotactic body radiation therapy, radiation oncology has 
      recently entered in the era of precision medicine. Despite these precise irradiation 
      modalities, lung cancers remain one of the most aggressive human cancers worldwide, 
      possibly because of diverse genotypic alterations that drive and maintain lung 
      tumorigenesis. It has been long recognized that imaging could aid in the diagnosis, 
      tumor delineation, and monitoring of lung cancer. Moreover, accumulating evidence 
      suggests that imaging information could be further used to tailor treatment type and 
      intensity, as well as predict treatment outcomes in radiotherapy. However, these 
      imaging tasks have been carried out either qualitatively or using simplistic metrics 
      that doesn't take advantage of the full scale of imaging knowledge. Radiomics, which 
      is a recent field of research that aims to provide a more quantitative 
      representation of imaging information relating tumor phenotypes to clinical and 
      genotypic endpoints by embedding extracted image features into predictive 
      mathematical models. These predictive models can be a key component in the clinician 
      decision making and treatment personalization. This review provides an overview of 
      the radiomics application and its methodology for radiation oncology studies in lung 
      cancer.
